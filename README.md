Inscripted doesn't feature typical classes. Items are the main way for players to express themselves! Items are one of the cores of a player's build, and there are many item archetypes that can help the player achieve their ideal build! Each archetype reinforces a particular playstyle and they can be mixed and matched together to fit one's needs!


Next will be the descriptions and general characteristics of all current archetypes:

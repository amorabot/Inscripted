### The item system is meant to allow for expressive build creation, mixing and matching all the different items and their stats to fit your preferred style!

Equippable items can be one of two types: **Craftables** or **Relics**! Craftable items can have their Inscriptions modified to your needs with currencies, such as Orbs, while Relic items cannot!

A Relics main purpose is to turn some of the game mechanics on their head and subvert the use of some stats, allowing for even quirkier builds!
This way you can, for instance, take advantage of the Inscription combinations available only for certain item [Archetypes](#The-Attribute-trinity), while counter-balancing the negative effects of a mighty Relic!

### One of the core principles of the item system is that obtaining a desired item is pretty much a deterministic process. Not easy. Deterministic.

Through Orbs, you can manipulate procedural items to achieve a desired combination of Inscriptions and achieve the playstyle for you. Also you NEED a specific Relic item to bring your dream build to life? There will be a way to grind to it.

The itemization was designed around the concepts of item archetypes and attribute-alignment (Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence alignments), meaning items are meant to be representative of the
attribute they're aligned and have somewhat predictable characteristics.

That means, for instance, that Strength-Aligned items will have a set of characteristics in common
and typically fit a Archetype that reinforces certain mehcanical, strategic and class-fantasy aspects of play! Check out the [section](#Core-Archetypes) dedicated to showcasing Archetype roles and attribute-alignments!

The collapsable sections below are a showcase of what some Inscripted items look like!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inscripted doesn't feature typical classes. Items are the main way for players to express themselves! Items are one of the cores of a player's build, and there are many item archetypes that can help one achieve their ideal build! Each archetype reinforces a particular playstyle and they can be mixed and matched together to fit one's needs!

![STR](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/d3ac961a-b556-4d9e-b672-b25967463820) The strength attribute is represented by the element Fire aswell as physical stats (damage & mitigation).

![DEX](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/c67f9dcd-c9c3-4956-b1fa-3e7e78c6be5c) The dexterity attribute is represented by the element Lightning aswell as evasiveness and mobility stats.

![INT](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/85a0fec7-05a0-4065-9d50-01beb940a423) The intelligence attribute is represented by the element Cold aswell as elemental and stamina stats.

Some archetypes will represent a mixture of the main 3 attribute's characteristics. For example, the Gladiator is a hybrid class that taps both into Strength and Dexterity.

--------------------------------------------------

## Itemization example:

### One of the core archetypes is the Templar! A god-fearing warrior with a mighty body and unwavering faith.

As you wil see in the next section about the archetypes themselves, the Templar is a Hybrid Archetype that mixes both aspects of Strength and Intelligence.
When choosing templar items, you are a blank canvas:

![image](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/6fac0327-09ba-430a-bc5e-a3bb5b408d40)

### And you can choose wether you want to take advantage of your physical strength to overpower your foes (More Strength-Aligned):

![image](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/681dfb5a-b819-4c6f-8dec-a13d0dde0caa)

### Or channel your faith and connection with the arcane through your Mace, piercing through the enemies resistances (More Intelligence Aligned):

![image](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/8ccfb02c-00fe-45a5-b938-021353c3367d)

### Or a mixture of both!

### And Relic items exist as a way to reinforce those decisions or create new ones entirely!

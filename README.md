The item system is meant to allow for expressive build creation, mixing and matching all the different items and their stats to fit your preferred style! It also offers procedural item generation and customization, where most items will have a unique modifier pool that will offer unique stat combinations that can only be found on certain items. The exception are the so-called Relic items (Pre-defined and rarer), that will bend some of the game mechanics and subvert the use of some stats, allowing for even quirkier builds!

One of the core principles of the item system is that obtaining a desired item is pretty much a deterministic process. Not easy. Deterministic. Through Orbs (And later on NPCs), you can manipulate procedural items to achieve a desired combination of Inscriptions (Modifiers that grant stats for your character, basically). Do you NEED a specific Relic item to bring your dream build to life? There will be a way to grind to it.

The itemization was designed around the concepts of item archetypes and attribute-alignment (Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence alignments), meaning items are meant to be representative of the
attribute they're aligned with and their general characteristics aswell as their general archetype roles. That means, for instance, that Strength-Aligned items will have a set of characteristics in common
and typically fit a Archetype that reinforces certain mehcanical, strategic and class-fantasy aspects of play! There's a entire section dedicated to showcasing Archetype roles and attribute-alignment, go check it out!

The collapsable sections below are a showcase of what some Inscripted items look like!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inscripted doesn't feature typical classes. Items are the main way for players to express themselves! Items are one of the cores of a player's build, and there are many item archetypes that can help one achieve their ideal build! Each archetype reinforces a particular playstyle and they can be mixed and matched together to fit one's needs!

The strength attribute will typically represent physical stats (damage, mitigation) and it's associated element is Fire.

![DEX](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/c67f9dcd-c9c3-4956-b1fa-3e7e78c6be5c)
The dexterity attribute will typically represent evasiveness and movement speed stats. It's associated element is Lightning.

![INT](https://github.com/amorabot/Inscripted/assets/16783145/85a0fec7-05a0-4065-9d50-01beb940a423)
The intelligence attribute will typically represent elemental stats and stamina. It's associated element is Cold.

Some archetypes will represent a mixture of the main 3 attribute's characteristics. For example, the Gladiator is a hybrid class that taps both into Strength and Dexterity.

--------------------------------------------------

## Example:

### A typical axe will be a strength-aligned weapon that fits the Marauder archetype. A more specialized and rarer axe, like Relic Axes, can bend those rules and still be alligned with the strength attribute but offer tradeoffs for being able to tap into other achetype's typical characteristics, allowing for more fun and diverse builds(A axe could convert a fraction of your fire damage into cold, but increase your cold damage taken, leaning into Intelligence but giving tradeoffs). 
--------------------------------------------------

Next will be the descriptions and general characteristics of all current archetypes:
